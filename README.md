# Fatalities in Yemen's Civil War

Yemen’s civil war began in March 2015 between Yemeni government forces aligned with President Abdrabbuh Mansur Hadi, and a rebel force called the Houthi Movement. Since then, the conflict has devolved into a chaotic web of government forces, militias, and foreign entities who form alliances of convenience one moment and then dissolve them the next. This project attempts to make sense of this chaos through mapping and analyzing instances, methods, and attributability of attacks.

# Data 

The Armed Conflict Location & Event Data (ACLED) Project is a “disaggregated data collection, analysis and crisis mapping project” that has collected an incredibly detailed account of political violence and protest events. This app uses data from their collection on Yemen between 1 January 2015 and 8 October 2019, which they have generously made available for public use.
